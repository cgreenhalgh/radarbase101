"REDCap accomplishes key functions through use of a single
study metadata table referenced by presentation-level operational
modules."

"The REDCap project uses PHP + JavaScript programming
languages and a MySQL database engine"

"(2009-2012) ... The REDCap development team at Vanderbilt designed new software modules to facilitate clinical trials (e.g., participant randomization, data query workflow) and support direct data
capture from patients via user-facing surveys. ... We also built a “plug-in” development framework that allowed local developers to add custom REDCap functionality
for individual projects. An initial set of restful API methods were developed and disseminated to enable back-end, record-level data transactions for local teams desiring to build interoperability between
REDCap and other systems. Initial API functionality included basic data
import and export features, but later evolved to include more sophisticated methods (e.g., project creation, project metadata editing, project
users and user rights management)."

"(2013-2018) ... New telephone and SMS-based survey features, “offline” functionality via the REDCap mobile application for coordinators, and a
separate mobile application (MyCap, https://www.projectmycap.org)
for participants ... The growth of the
REDCap Consortium and user base has created opportunities to collaborate with other consortia (e.g., PhenX [52,53], Medical Data Models
[54], BioPortal [55], PROMIS [56]) to integrate standardized terminologies and instruments."
